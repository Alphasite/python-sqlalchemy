## Examples

This directory contains examples of tracing applications using the sqlalchemy package. To run the examples, make sure you've installed the package `opentracing`. If you have access to a tracing platform and would like to view the created spans, replace the `tracer` in the example files with the tracer of your choice.

Then simply:

```
> python example-file.py
```
